/**
 * USBMSD class: generic class in order to use all kinds of blocks storage chip
 *
 * Introduction
 *
 * The USBMSD implements the MSD protocol. It permits to access a memory chip (flash, sdcard,...)
 * from a computer over USB. But this class doesn't work standalone, you need to subclass this class
 * and define virtual functions which are called in USBMSD.
 *
 * How to use this class with your chip ?
 *
 * You have to inherit and define some pure virtual functions (mandatory step):
 *   - virtual int disk_read(char * data, int block): function to read a block
 *   - virtual int disk_write(const char * data, int block): function to write a block
 *   - virtual int disk_initialize(): function to initialize the memory
 *   - virtual int disk_sectors(): return the number of blocks
 *   - virtual int disk_size(): return the memory size
 *   - virtual int disk_status(): return the status of the storage chip (0: OK, 1: not initialized, 2: no medium in the drive, 4: write protection)
 *
 * All functions names are compatible with the fat filesystem library. So you can imagine using your own class with
 * USBMSD and the fat filesystem library in the same program. Just be careful because there are two different parts which
 * will access the sd card. You can do a master/slave system using the disk_status method.
 *
 * Once these functions defined, you can call connect() (at the end of the constructor of your class for instance)
 * of USBMSD to connect your mass storage device. connect() will first call disk_status() to test the status of the disk.
 * If disk_status() returns 1 (disk not initialized), then disk_initialize() is called. After this step, connect() will collect information
 * such as the number of blocks and the memory size.
