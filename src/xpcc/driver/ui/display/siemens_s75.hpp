	/**
	 * \brief	Driver for Siemens S75/CX75/C81/M75 displays
	 *
	 * The controller in displays manufactured by Alps is a
	 * SOLOMON SYSTECH SSD1286 which can drive color
	 * displays of up to 132 x 176 pixels in 18 bit colour.
	 *
	 * The portrait mode is a bit more 'native' for this display because
	 * xpcc::BufferedGraphicDisplay requests that the vertical resolution is
	 * dividable by 8.
	 *
	 * In portrait mode the connector is at the bottom.
	 * In landscape mode the connector is at the right border.
	 *
	 * Pinout at LCD:
	 *  1  IN  CD         Command / Data                      Low = Command (Register) High = Data.
	 *  2  IN  RESET      Resets the display.  Active low.    Low = Reset,             High = No reset.
	 *  3  IN  CS         Chip select.         Active low.    Low = Chip is selected,  High = Chip is not selected.
	 *  4  OUT VD         Sync Output.         Unused.
	 *  5      GND        Supply
	 *  6  IN  D0         Bit 0 of parallel data
	 *  7      3V3 (2V9)  Supply
	 *  8      GND        Supply
	 *  9      VLED +     Supply Backlight
	 * 10      VLED -     Supply Backlight
	 * 11      GND        Supply
	 * 12  IN  RD         Read Strobe.         Unused.
	 * 13  IN  WR         Write Strobe.        High-to-Low strobe write data to display memory.
	 * 14  IN  D1         Bit 1 of parallel data.
	 * 15  IN  D2         Bit 2 of parallel data.
	 * 16  IN  D3         Bit 3 of parallel data.
	 * 17  IN  D4         Bit 4 of parallel data.
	 * 18  IN  D5         Bit 5 of parallel data.
	 * 19  IN  D6         Bit 6 of parallel data.
	 * 20  IN  D7         Bit 7 of parallel data.
	 *
	 * The backlight (VLED +, VLED -) consists of four white
	 * LEDs in series. The forward voltage is about 12 volts.
